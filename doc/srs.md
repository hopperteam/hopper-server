## 1. Introduction  

### 1.1 Purpose  
Hopper is a tool, which allows you to merge your information streams into a simple, easy-to-use and extendable interface. It is independent from where you are, what device you are using or what kind of information you are receiving.  

### 1.2 Scope  

This software specification applies for the whole hopper project. Users will be able to register the specified services and their respective notifications will be funneled into one dashboard.

## 2. Overall Description  

### 2.1 Vision  

Today, we are living in a time of abundance. Be it materialistic or informational. It is quite easy to access all information in the world within seconds, but it is quite difficult to keep track of the information you really need.

We are introducing a way to overcome this challenge â€“ with hopper. Hopper is a tool, which allows you to merge your information streams into a simple, easy-to-use and extendable interface. It is independent from where you are, what device you are using or what kind of information you are receiving.

The majority of information streams are based on notifications. You receive them, usually on your phone, and try to keep track of them all. Hopper is a central place for your notifications. It keeps track of them and lets you filter them, to only keep track of what is really important to you.
